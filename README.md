# Name-Project
In this project, you work with the data files provided in the "Names" folder in the files section. These files contain national data on the relative frequency of given names in the population of U.S. births where the individual has a Social Security Number. For each year of birth YYYY after 1879, there is a comma-delimited file called yobYYYY.txt. Each record in the individual annual files has the format "name,sex,number," where "name" is 2 to 15 characters, "sex" is M (male) or F (female) and "number" is the number of occurrences of the name. Each file is sorted first on sex and then on number of occurrences in descending order. You are tasked with creating an application that will show how often a certain name has been used throughout history in the United States.

In MATLAB, GUI should be able to refresh whenever the user selects to plot absolute number of occurrences or the popularity percentage.
